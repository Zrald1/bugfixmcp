# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/Zrald1/bugfixmcp.git

# Rename your current branch to main (if it's not already called main)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Your Repository

2. You should see your code and files in the repository
3. Check that the README.md is displayed on the main page
4. Verify that all the important files are present:
   - src/ directory with your source code
   - bin/ directory with the CLI script
   - package.json with the correct configuration

5. Click "Save"

## Step 5: Create a Release

After your code is pushed to GitHub:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Releases" on the right side

5. Click "Publish release"

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Authentication errors**: Make sure you're using the correct GitHub credentials

1. Follow the NPM_PUBLISHING.md guide to publish your package to npm
2. Share your repository link with others
3. Consider setting up GitHub Actions for continuous integration
